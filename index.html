            <h3>Traveler and Learner</h3>
            <p>You may have noticed me jumping,climbing mountains,laughing and taking weird selfies.But trust me! you
                can't
                prevent me from travelling because this is where I am more of myself than other self.During any tour, I
                am
                able to learn about new cultures, friends, foods and languages. However, You may feel thrill or even
                fear in
                any particular trip but believe me it will be one of the most rewarding and exploring things you ever
                do.

            <h2>Become a Self-dependent</h2>
            <p>Happiness is being independent. Always rely on yourself because in the end we're all we got..Don't lean
                on others,we don't need to.We are enough to make great changes if we want to. we need to have our inner
                confidence and make our own decisions.we have only one life so we need to make most of it.
